## Hi, I'm Stanley Eng 

# About me
I'm a third-year Computer Science major at Oregon State University passionate about building full-stack applications and software engineering. 
I'm currently involved in student clubs at my university such as the Hackathon Club and Google Developer Group. 

In my free time, I love to play tennis, eat good food, and spend time with friends or family.
